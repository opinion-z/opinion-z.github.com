Z: I have just learned the worst thing
Z: In that I have played Red Dead Redemption completely the wrong way
Z: Played it and beaten it
Z: Had no idea about what I had just done
Z: http://reddead.wikia.com/wiki/Difficulty#Hardcore_Mode
Z: >mfw I selected this mode as I thought it was the games hard mode
Z: >Find out now that it was exclusive to the GOTY version
Z: So I had suffered a bunch of deaths and loading screens as a result of my deaths
Z: because I didn't choose the normal AKA real way people played RDR
Z: So I didn't technically experience the real RDR that people have been used to
Z: And to be honest. Despite the increase in all of that stuff you see
Z: Like lower health and less health regen
Z: The game still felt fair
Z: So I was never butt frustrated at it or mad at it
Z: Why it fucks with me
Z: Is that now I learn
Z: RDR is super fucking easy
Z: and gives you a ton of money
Z: if you play it the normal way
Z: Although this is second hand information
Z: I'm gonna try it soon
Z: It just blows my mind
Z: That this was never the intention for me to play RDR
Z: So I'm scared in a way
Z: That the good will that the game gave me
Z: Will go away
Z: when I play a dull and easy third person shooter
Z: with money flying at me in everyway
Z: Like in hardcore mode
Z: I was never really starving for money
Z: I had to loot more corpses for money I'm guessing
Z: As I would buy strongholds
Z: and wouldn't have the money for a new shotgun say
Z: That was about it in terms of not really relying on money
Z: The health thing comes to ahead when you're in a tight situation and the guy whips out his gun and annhilates you without you even thinking about it
Z: Otherwise the difficulty is absolutely fine
Z: As the dead eye system is a big help in that regard
Z: >mfw I read on that wiki that it automatically regenerates normally
Z: >hardcore you either kill people or use items to refill it
Z: I mean this isn't on par with somebody playing a game for 10 hours
Z: and not knowing an ability
Z: This is a complete game changer
Z: As again. Hardcore mode doesn't exist in any other copy of RDR besides the GOTY edition
Z: it was never even released as DLC
Z: So a game that I thought I really enjoyed
Z: and loved
Z: Is apaprently not that game at all
Z: It's like Jack Nicholson finding out his sister was his mother all along
Z: http://www.nndb.com/people/722/000022656/ >The girl Nicholson thought was his sister was actually his mother, who had become pregnant in high school. The woman he thought was his mother was really his grandmother. And in a heartwrenching twist to the tale, Nicholson says he never knew any of this until he became famous -- after both women were dead -- when Time Magazine published an expos√©
Z: okay maybe not that traumatizing

Z: Let me get to it though
Z: In reviews I've heard "bullet sponges" thrown around to describe the enemies. That is highly accurate.
Z: I feel like I'm just shooting pellets or BBs at these things
Z: Even humans seem to be made of some type of organic bullet proof armour that helps them survive 4 shotgun blasts to the face
Z: The hit detection is lousy and the fact that it takes forever to kill things just makes it feel like one gigantic slog and like almost every enemy is like a mini boss in any other game
Z: Interescting with that. The melee combat for some reason I was hoping would save RE ORC. However it's just a simple mashing of one button and then maybe another button to get them to do a potentially insta kill(depends on the character) which can be directed with the analogue stick as you mash the button
Z: Meleeing enemies also takes awhile to kill anything
Z: The one thing that would have made RE Orc really fun. Is if the enemies were just like wet paper. But there was a lot more of them to deal with
Z: Which doesn't sound like an unreasonable request. It does that bullshit Doom 3 did where enemy corpses disappeared into a flash of ash like something out of Blade
Z: So if it was about enemies on screen, that wouldn't necessarily be a problem. Especially after you kill them
Z: RAGE's co-op is very fun and very visceral in comparison to what RE Orc offers
Z: Despite them beefing up enemies in the co-op. A lot of the time you can just tear through them
Z: Blowing away a bunch of mutants non stop to almost a point of numbness from the shotgun blasts and mutant murder in RAGE is what RE ORC should have been.
Z: If they want to go the action game route. Which I understand. I'm fine with that.
Z: But for god sakes include some manuevarbility
Z: If RE Orc has fallen on its sword from the way it's such a slog at killing creatures. Then it definitely also triggers a Rube Goldbergian machine to drop a bowling ball on its head just to make sure.
Z: I sometimes have criticized Gears of War for making me feel like I am playing a gigantic and unwieldy football player with a gun
Z: However you had something as simple as a roll with Marcus Fenix
Z: You can find yourself surrounded by zombies and getting chomped on/vomitted on. Or like I was. Cornered by the tyrant who just kept on slapping my shit before I could get up
Z: Or the worst offender. As I can at least excuse the Tyrant thing.
Z: Hunters. They run and jump at you with claw attacks
Z: The only thing you can do is click the run stick then press X or A to dive
Z: Which is just a short dive forward
Z: Not one to the side or even backwards
Z: Just forward
Z: Now combine that with a slow and sluggish character that has barely any lateral maneuvers
Z: And you become human stew for the hunters
Z: There is nothing smart or intuitive about the control scheme. Which comes to ahead again with the cover mechanics
Z: As there's no go into cover button
Z: Instead. You have to push forward into the cover
Z: Which even sometimes slightly grazing a wall you can sometimes accidentally stick to it
