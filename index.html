Z: Let me get to it though
Z: In reviews I've heard "bullet sponges" thrown around to describe the enemies. That is highly accurate.
Z: I feel like I'm just shooting pellets or BBs at these things
Z: Even humans seem to be made of some type of organic bullet proof armour that helps them survive 4 shotgun blasts to the face
Z: The hit detection is lousy and the fact that it takes forever to kill things just makes it feel like one gigantic slog and like almost every enemy is like a mini boss in any other game
Z: Interescting with that. The melee combat for some reason I was hoping would save RE ORC. However it's just a simple mashing of one button and then maybe another button to get them to do a potentially insta kill(depends on the character) which can be directed with the analogue stick as you mash the button
Z: Meleeing enemies also takes awhile to kill anything
Z: The one thing that would have made RE Orc really fun. Is if the enemies were just like wet paper. But there was a lot more of them to deal with
Z: Which doesn't sound like an unreasonable request. It does that bullshit Doom 3 did where enemy corpses disappeared into a flash of ash like something out of Blade
Z: So if it was about enemies on screen, that wouldn't necessarily be a problem. Especially after you kill them
Z: RAGE's co-op is very fun and very visceral in comparison to what RE Orc offers
Z: Despite them beefing up enemies in the co-op. A lot of the time you can just tear through them
Z: Blowing away a bunch of mutants non stop to almost a point of numbness from the shotgun blasts and mutant murder in RAGE is what RE ORC should have been.
Z: If they want to go the action game route. Which I understand. I'm fine with that.
Z: But for god sakes include some manuevarbility
Z: If RE Orc has fallen on its sword from the way it's such a slog at killing creatures. Then it definitely also triggers a Rube Goldbergian machine to drop a bowling ball on its head just to make sure.
Z: I sometimes have criticized Gears of War for making me feel like I am playing a gigantic and unwieldy football player with a gun
Z: However you had something as simple as a roll with Marcus Fenix
Z: You can find yourself surrounded by zombies and getting chomped on/vomitted on. Or like I was. Cornered by the tyrant who just kept on slapping my shit before I could get up
Z: Or the worst offender. As I can at least excuse the Tyrant thing.
Z: Hunters. They run and jump at you with claw attacks
Z: The only thing you can do is click the run stick then press X or A to dive
Z: Which is just a short dive forward
Z: Not one to the side or even backwards
Z: Just forward
Z: Now combine that with a slow and sluggish character that has barely any lateral maneuvers
Z: And you become human stew for the hunters
Z: There is nothing smart or intuitive about the control scheme. Which comes to ahead again with the cover mechanics
Z: As there's no go into cover button
Z: Instead. You have to push forward into the cover
Z: Which even sometimes slightly grazing a wall you can sometimes accidentally stick to it
